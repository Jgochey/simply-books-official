## About the User
- A fun app for someone who wishes to catalouge their favorite Books and Authors.
- Also useful for keeping track of sale prices for future book purchases.

## Features
- After logging in with Google, clicking the Authors tab will allow the user to create new Author entries specific to them.
   Users are prompted to fill out the Author's first name, last name, e-mail address and are given the option of setting that author as a favorite.
- When an author entry has been created, navigating to the books page will allow the creation of new book entries.
   The criteria for a new book entry is a book title, an image of the book, the price of the book, and a description. Users are also prompted to
   assign an Author to the book and select whether or not the book is on sale.
- Both Books and Authors have a "view" button associated with them that will display more details about them. Users can also edit or delete both
   their book and author entries.
